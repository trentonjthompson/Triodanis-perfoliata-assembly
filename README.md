# Triodanis-perfoliata-assembly
Chromosome-level, de novo genome assembly of Triodanis perfoliata that utilizes a hybrid sequencing approach. This includes the incorporation of Nanopore long reads, Illumina short reads, and high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) data to assemble the genome, annotate genes, and comparative genomic analyses with close relatives.
